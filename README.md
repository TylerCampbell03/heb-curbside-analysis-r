# H-E-B Curbside Statistical Analysis (R Project)

This project is a statistical analysis of a simulated SQL database for H-E-B's Curbside operations. The database includes customer orders, labor stats, survey feedback, and operational metrics. The entire analysis is conducted in **R**, including:

- SQL database connection
- Data cleaning and joining with `dplyr`
- Visualizations with `ggplot2`
- Summary statistics with `kableExtra`
- Linear regression analysis

## 📂 Files

- `rmd.Rmd` – Full R Markdown analysis
- `NO CODE` – Final PDF output (with code hidden)
- `WITH CODE` - Final PDF output (with code)
- Any additional assets (charts, screenshots)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Explored revenue vs. labor cost over time
- Customer survey rating distribution
- Regression analysis on:
  - Order size vs number of items
  - Order size vs customer ratings

This project is part of my growing portfolio in data science, with an emphasis on applying R to real-world structured data.
